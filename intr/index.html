<h1><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">ABOUT </h1>
                    <p><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">
                        SAP was founded in 1972 in Walldorf, Germany. It stands for Systems,
Applications and Products in Data Processing. Over the years, it has grown
and evolved to become the world premier provider of client/server business
solutions for which it is so well known today. The SAP enterprise application
suite for open client/server systems has established a new standards for
providing business information management solutions.
<p>SAP product are consider excellent but not perfect.&nbsp; The main problems
with software product is that it can never be perfect.
<p>The main advantage of using SAP as your company ERP system is that SAP
have a very high level of integration among its individual applications
which guarantee consistency of data throughout the system and the company
itself.</p></span>

<h1>ENVIRONMENTS </h1>
                    <p> In a standard SAP project system, it is divided into three environments,
<b>Development,
Quality Assurance and Production</font></b>.
<p>The development system is where most of the implementation work takes
place. The quality assurance system is where all the final testing is conducted
before moving the transports to the production environment.&nbsp; The production
system is where all the daily business activities occur.&nbsp; It is also
the client that all the end users use to perform their daily job functions.
<p>To all company, the production system should only contains transport
that have passed all the tests.
<p>SAP is a table drive customization software.&nbsp; It allows businesses
to make rapid changes in their business requirements with a common set
of programs.&nbsp; User-exits are provided for business to add in additional
source code.&nbsp; Tools such as screen variants are provided to let you
set fields attributes whether to hide, display and make them mandatory fields.</p><br />

<h1>CLIENT, CUSTOMIZATION AND CONFIGURATION </h1>
                    <p>
                        <b><font size=+1>What is Client? What is the difference between Customization
and Configuration?</font></b>
<p>The difference between cutomizing and configuration is:
<br>- CONFIGURATION: we will configure the system to meet the needs of
your business by using the existing data.
<br>- CUSTOMIZING: we will customise or adapt the system to your business
requirements, which is the process of mapping SAP to your business process.
<br>- CLIENT: A client is a unique one in organizational structure, can
have one or more company codes. Each company code is its own legal entity
in finance.
<p><b>Configuration&nbsp; vs. Customization</b>
<br>When considering enterprise software of any type, it is important to
understand the difference between configuration and customization.The crux
of the difference is complexity. Configuration uses the inherent flexibility
of the enterprise software to add fields, change field names,modify drop-down
lists, or add buttons. Configurations are made using powerful built-in
tool sets. Customization involves code changes to create functionality
that is not available through configuration. Customization can be costly
and can complicate future upgrades to the software because the code changes
may not easily migrate to the new version.Wherever possible, governments
should avoid customization by using configuration to meet their goals.Governments
also should understand their vendor's particular terminology with regard
to this issue since words like "modifications" or "extensions" often mean
different things to different vendors.
